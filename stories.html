          <h3>Bholi's Brave Heart</h3>
          <div class="story-details-container" style="display: none;">
            <img src="images/bholi.jpg" alt="Bholi" class="story-image">
            <div class="story-text-content">
              <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bholi</p>
              <p><strong>Age:</strong> 2 years</p>
              <p><strong>Breed:</strong> Indie</p>
              <p><strong>Medical History:</strong> Vaccinated, Spayed</p>
              <p><strong>Backstory:</strong>🐱 Meet Bholi — The Sweet Survivor with a Heart of Gold
Bholi’s story began on the streets, behind a little tea stall where she was born to a stray mother. Life wasn’t easy for her — every day was a search for food, safety, and a dry place to sleep. While her siblings were wild and fearless, Bholi was different. She was quiet, gentle, and had the softest eyes that seemed to ask for love rather than fight for it.

One rainy evening, as thunder rolled and the streets flooded, Bholi took shelter under a bench near that tea stall — soaked, shivering, and meowing softly for help. That’s when a kind soul noticed her, scooped her up, and wrapped her in a warm jacket. That moment changed her life forever.

In her foster home, Bholi slowly bloomed from a scared kitten into a loving, playful companion. She learned that hands could offer gentle pets instead of danger, and that a home could mean warmth, food, and affection. She loves curling up near a window, watching the rain she once feared, and greeting people with her soft, curious gaze.

Bholi is an indie cat — strong, intelligent, and full of personality. She’s fully vaccinated, litter-trained, and ready to bring joy to a forever family. She’s the kind of cat who doesn’t demand attention but gives you unconditional love once she trusts you.

If you’re looking for a calm, affectionate friend who’ll fill your home with quiet love and endless purrs, Bholi is waiting for you. 💛

          <h3>Browny's Second Chance</h3>
          <div class="story-details-container" style="display: none;">
            <img src="images/browny.jpg" alt="Browny" class="story-image">
            <div class="story-text-content">
              <p><strong>Name:</strong> Browny</p>
              <p><strong>Age:</strong> 1 years</p>
              <p><strong>Breed:</strong> indie </p>
              <p><strong>Medical History:</strong> Vaccinated, Neutered</p>
              <p><strong>Backstory:</strong>browny wasn’t always alone — she once lived near a small construction site where workers fed her leftovers and played with her during breaks. She grew up surrounded by laughter, the smell of food, and the sound of hammering and chatter. But when the project ended, everyone packed up and left… except Browny.

For weeks, she waited near the gate, wagging her tail every time she heard footsteps, hoping her friends would return. But no one did.

One day, a passerby noticed her — thin, tired, but still hopeful — and offered her some food. That simple act of kindness changed everything. With the help of a local rescuer, Browny was brought to safety, given medical care, and slowly regained her cheerful spark.

Now, Browny is the definition of resilience — playful, loyal, and full of love. She adores belly rubs, naps in sunny spots, and follows her humans around like a tiny shadow. All she needs now is a forever home that’ll never leave her behind again. ❤️</p>
